# Bookshelf App

To practice the concepts I learned in Unit 5 of [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course), including coroutines, Retrofit, and Gson, I build this Android app that displays a list of books with images from the Google Books API.
